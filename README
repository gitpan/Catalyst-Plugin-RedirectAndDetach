NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::RedirectAndDetach - Redirect and detach at the same
    time

SYNOPSIS
        # load the plugin

        use Catalyst qw( RedirectAndDetach );

        # in your controller ...

        sub admin
        {
            my $self = shift;
            my $c    = shift;

            $c->redirect_and_detach('/')
                unless $c->stash()->{user}->is_admin();

            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    I generally find that if I want to issue a redirect in my web app, I
    want to stop processing right there. This plugin adds a ridiculously
    simply method to your Catalyst objects to do just that.

METHODS
    This class provides one method:

  $c->redirect_and_detach( $uri, $status )
    The $uri parameter is required, and $status is optional. Internally,
    this just calls "redirect()" on the Response object, followed by
    "detach()".
